"""
Charge/Discharge Strategy: The battery is charged/discharged at various time steps to minimize total cost, taking advantage of times when electricity prices are low to charge and discharging when prices are high (or based on availability of renewable energy).
SOC Evolution: The state of charge (SOC) evolves over time according to the charging/discharging decisions while respecting battery constraints.
Grid Interaction: The grid buy/sell values show how much energy is drawn from or supplied to the grid at each time step to balance supply and demand, given the renewable generation, load, and battery operations.
Objective Value: The total cost indicates the minimized net cost of purchasing energy from the grid minus the revenue from selling energy to the grid over the 24-hour horizon.
